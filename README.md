# Perplex
This project is technically a password manager, but is very different from the traditional concept. Perplex aims to create a unique password for every website that depends on only three things: the name of the user, his master key, and the website for which he would like to generate a password. The genius in this idea is that these passwords are never stored anywhere, nor are they sent over the internet or stored in a cloud. This is perfect security-wise, as it limits greatly the risk of interception by an attacker or leak in a data dump. But, you ask me, if a password generated by Perplex were to be exposed, would a hacker be able to figure out the master key, if he knew the name of the user and the website used? Well, the algorithm used by Perplex is one of the most secure you could find. The input data is hashed using SHA256, and encrypted together in two different ways with AES128. These two encryption algorithms are both considered unbreakable by today's cryptographic experts, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Furthermore, this project is open-source, and everyone is welcome to go through the code used by Perplex.

PERPLEX IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, BUT WILL SOON BE RELEASED FOR MACOS, WINDOWS, LINUX, IOS AND ANDROID.
